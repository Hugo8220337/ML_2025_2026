	abstract = {Fake news, or fabric which appeared to be untrue with point of deceiving the open, has developed in ubiquity in current a long time. Spreading this kind of data undermines societal cohesiveness and well by cultivating political division and doubt in government. Since of the sheer volume of news being disseminated through social media, human confirmation has ended up incomprehensible, driving to the improvement and arrangement of robotized strategies for the recognizable proof of wrong news. Fake news publishers use a variety of stylistic techniques to boost the popularity of their works, one of which is to arouse the readers’ emotions. Due to this, text analytics’ sentiment analysis, which determines the polarity and intensity of feelings conveyed in a text, is now being utilized in false news detection methods, as either the system’s foundation or as a supplementary component. This assessment analyzes the full explanation of false news identification. The study also emphasizes characteristics, features, taxonomy, different sorts of data in the news, categories of false news, and detection approaches for spotting fake news. This research recognized fake news using the probabilistic latent semantic analysis approach. In particular, the research describes the fundamental theory of the related work to provide a deep comparative analysis of various literature works that has contributed to this topic. Besides this, a comparison of different machine learning and deep learning techniques is done to assess the performance for fake news detection. For this purpose, three datasets have been used.},

	abstract = {In today's world of social media and politics, detection of false news is a crucial area for research. There may be difficulties because there aren't as many resources, such as published literature and available datasets. In this work, we advise using machine learning techniques to spot fake news. Three different machine learning categorization methods are compared. Decision tree classifier, random forest classifier, and logistic regression were the three techniques we employed. We have obtained varying degrees of accuracy for each method. The obtained results are helpful in detecting the veracity of the specified news.},

	abstract = {The rapid dissemination of information has been accompanied by the proliferation of fake news, posing significant challenges in discerning authentic news from fabricated narratives. This study addresses the urgent need for effective fake news detection mechanisms. The spread of fake news on digital platforms has necessitated the development of sophisticated tools for accurate detection and classification. Deep learning models, particularly Bi-LSTM and attention-based Bi-LSTM architectures, have shown promise in tackling this issue. This research utilized Bi-LSTM and attention-based Bi-LSTM models, integrating an attention mechanism to assess the significance of different parts of the input data. The models were trained on an 80\% subset of the data and tested on the remaining 20\%, employing comprehensive evaluation metrics including Recall, Precision, F1-Score, Accuracy, and Loss. Comparative analysis with existing models revealed the superior efficacy of the proposed architectures. The attention-based Bi-LSTM model demonstrated remarkable proficiency, outperforming other models in terms of accuracy (97.66\%) and other key metrics. The study highlighted the potential of integrating advanced deep learning techniques in fake news detection. The proposed models set new standards in the field, offering effective tools for combating misinformation. Limitations such as data dependency, potential for overfitting, and language and context specificity were acknowledged. The research underscores the importance of leveraging cutting-edge deep learning methodologies, particularly attention mechanisms, in fake news identification. The innovative models presented pave the way for more robust solutions to counter misinformation, thereby preserving the veracity of digital information. Future research should focus on enhancing data diversity, model efficiency, and applicability across various languages and contexts.},

	abstract = {Fake News Detection is an essential problem in the field of Natural Language Processing. The benefits of an effective solution in this area are manifold for the goodwill of society. On a surface level, it broadly matches with the general problem of text classification. Researchers have proposed various approaches to tackle fake news using simple as well as some complex techniques. In this paper, we try to make a comparison between the present Deep Learning techniques by representing the news instances in some vector space using a combination of common mathematical operations with available vector space representations. We do a number of experiments using various combinations and permutations. Finally, we conclude with a sound analysis of the results and evaluate the reasons for such results.},

Trata-se de um estudo empírico quantitativo, realizado a partir das notificações recebidas pelo aplicativo brasileiro Eu Fiscalizo. Os resultados da pesquisa mostram que o WhatsApp é o principal canal de compartilhamento de fake news, seguido do Instagram e do Facebook. Conclui-se que a disseminação de conteúdos falsos relacionados a Covid-19 contribui para o descrédito da ciência e das instituições globais de saúde. E que a solução para esse problema passa por aumentar o nível de informações adequadas para a sociedade brasileira.Palavras-chaveFake news; Saúde; Pandemia; Pós-verdade; Covid-19},

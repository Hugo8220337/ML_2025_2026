FakeNewsNet

This is a repository for an ongoing data collection project for fake news research at ASU. We describe and compare FakeNewsNet with other existing datasets in Fake News Detection on Social Media: A Data Mining Perspective. We also perform a detail analysis of FakeNewsNet dataset, and build a fake news detection model on this dataset in Exploiting Tri-Relationship for Fake News Detection
